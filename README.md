BigNumber second ("200")          #Example

first + second;                   #Addition                
//Output: 100000200;

first - second;                   #Subtraction
//Output: 99999800;

first * second;                   #Multiplication
//Output: 20000000000;

first / second;                   #Division
//Output: 500000;

first % second;                   #Modulus
//Output: 0;

Â± first                           #Unary minus
//Output: -100000000;
  
AC                                #Clears the number inputed
